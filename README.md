# NLTK3.0_Tutorial



The main target of this document is to offer a brief guide to the NLTK 3.0 (NaturalLanguage Toolkit) and update the outdated contents discussed in Natural Language Processing with
Python (Steven, 2009). Because the book was published in 2009, many contexts were expired. Hence, this document combines the e-book based on NLTK 3.0 (Natural Language
Processing with Python) and the update blogs. However, it's impossible to cover all details in such a limited period and pages. So, I encourage you to dive into the NLTK’s official website (nltk.org) for more details.

Please contact me (ziyangz6@illinois.edu) if you find any mistakes or questions. Many thanks for any feedback in advance.
