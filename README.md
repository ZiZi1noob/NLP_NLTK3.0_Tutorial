# NLTK3.0_Tutorial 11/05/2021



The main target of this document is to offer a brief guide to the *NLTK 3.0* (Natural Language Toolkit) and update the outdated contents discussed in Natural Language Processing with Python (Steven, 2009). Because the book was published in 2009, many contexts were expired. Hence, this document combines the e-book based on NLTK 3.0 [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/) and the update blogs. However, it's impossible to cover all details in such a limited period and pages. So, I encourage you to dive into the NLTK’s official website (https://www.nltk.org/) for more details.

Please let me know (ziyangz6@illinois
